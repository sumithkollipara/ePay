| Folder | Project Name | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| CustomerManagement | CustomerManagement.Test| xUnit project. This has one mega test case which generates data(in a random pattern as stated in the test requirements) and push the data on server. It then retrieves the data that exists on the server and aligns the randomly generated data in a way that the application is supposed to persist and return the data that was posted and compares the 2 data sets.

#### Execution procedure:

Step1: Make sure to either delete or empty the ePayCustomerData.json file, file location is ePay\CustomerManagement\bin\Debug\net6.0

Step2: Run the CustomerManagement WebAPI project (Swagger UI will be loaded, feel free to Post and Get customers)
